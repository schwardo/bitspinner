There are two modes: turn-to-advance and auto-advance.  When turned on, BitSpinner is in turn-to-advance mode.  The counter starts at 0.  When the knob is turned clockwise, the counter is incremented by 1 for each click.  When the knob is turned counter-clockwise, the counter is decremented by 1 for each click.

If the Dec/Hex switch is set to Dec, the value of the counter is displayed in decimal (base 10).  If it is set to Hex, the value of the counter is displayed in hexadecimal (base 16).

The binary value of the counter is always displayed on the 10 rectangular LEDs.

When the knob is pressed like a button, it will enter auto-advance mode.  In this mode, the counter will advance by itself.  Turning the knob clockwise when in auto-advance mode will cause the counter to advance more quickly.  Turning the knob counter-clockwise will cause the counter to advance more slowly until it reaches the original speed, at which point the counter will begin advancing backwards.  Pressing the knob again will return to turn-to-advance mode.
