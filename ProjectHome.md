Do you already have a working BitSpinner?  See OperatingInstructions.

Do you have all of the parts required to assemble a BitSpinner?  See HowToBuild.

Do you have a bare PCB and want to obtain the rest of the parts?  See PartsList.

Don't have a PCB?  They're not available for order at the moment.  Feel free to download the Eagle or Gerber files in the source repository and have them made yourself.
